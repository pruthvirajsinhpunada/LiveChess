/// `LichessMatchSession` (vs. a remote human), the puzzle source is a
/// fixed solution sequence — the user plays one side, the app
/// auto-plays the opponent's expected reply.
///
/// State:
///   * `solveIndex` — index into `solution` of the move expected next.
///     The user's turn is when the position's side-to-move matches
///     `humanSide`; the opponent's auto-replies fire on the other
///     parity.
///   * `status: PuzzleStatus` — `.solving / .solved / .failed`. A
///     wrong human move sets `.failed`; the HUD's "Try again" button
///     calls `restart()` to put the user back at the start.
